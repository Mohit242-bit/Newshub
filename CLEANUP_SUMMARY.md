#  NewsHub Codebase Cleanup - Complete Summary

## Date: October 22, 2025

### Files Deleted (14 files removed)

####  Debug/Test Scripts (5 files)
- debug-api.js - Old API testing script
- 	est-services.js - Redundant service testing  
- 	est-article-quality.js - Old quality testing
- 	est-newsHub-fix.js - Outdated fix verification
- erify-fix.js - Old verification script

**Reason:** All functionality is now covered by the in-app debug panel. These scripts were one-off development tools no longer needed.

####  Planning/Setup Documentation (8 files)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - 620 lines, old step-by-step guide
- phase.md - 2125 lines, detailed development phases
- mvp-scope.md - 295 lines, initial MVP definition
- DEVELOPMENT_OPTIMIZATION.md - 169 lines, old optimization tips
- BEST_NEWS_SOURCES.md - 241 lines, research document
- DATA_FLOW_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md - 210 lines, pre-implementation flow
- RSS_FIXES.md - Old RSS fixes documentation
- oadmap.md - Initial roadmap
- QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md - Old quality issues document

**Reason:** These were development planning documents from the initial setup phase. All recommendations have been implemented. Project status is now tracked in PROJECT_STATUS.md.

####  Unused Config Files (2 files)
- Gemfile - Ruby gems file (not used in JavaScript project)
- igma-mcp-helper.ps1 - Figma helper script (not part of app)

**Reason:** Not part of the React Native application. Added by mistake during initial setup.
