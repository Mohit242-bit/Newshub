# NewsHub Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "Loading Articles" Stuck

### Problem Description
The app gets stuck on "Loading articles" screen and doesn't show any news content.

### Root Causes Identified & Fixed

#### 1. **Network Connectivity Issues**
- **Problem**: Emulator had no internet connectivity (100% packet loss)
- **Solution**: 
  - Restart ADB server: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`
  - Check emulator network settings
  - Verify host machine internet connection

#### 2. **Invalid API Keys**
- **Problem**: Guardian API returned "Unauthorized" errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced Guardian API as primary source with NewsAPI
  - Updated category services to use more reliable sources
  - Added proper fallback mechanisms

#### 3. **Duplicate Article IDs**
- **Problem**: React warnings about duplicate keys causing rendering issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved ID generation in all services
  - Added timestamps to ensure uniqueness
  - Used URL/title hashes for NewsAPI

#### 4. **Slow Timeouts & Retries**
- **Problem**: Long timeout values (5s) and multiple retries caused slow fallbacks
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced fetch timeout from 5s to 3s
  - Reduced retry timeout from 1.5s to 1s
  - Reduced max retries from 2 to 1
  - RSS timeout reduced from 5s to 2s

#### 5. **Poor Offline Experience**
- **Problem**: App showed empty state when network failed
- **Solution**: 
  - Added sample articles for offline fallback
  - Improved cache mechanism with persistent storage
  - Extended cache TTL from 10min to 15min
  - Added expired cache as last resort

### API Sources Priority (After Fix)

1. **Primary Sources** (Most Reliable):
   - NewsAPI (working, has valid key)
   - Dev.to (working, no key required)
   - HackerNews (working, no key required)

2. **Secondary Sources** (Backup):
   - Guardian API (unreliable, auth issues)
   - RSS feeds (slow, timeout issues)

### Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Reset Metro cache and restart
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Restart ADB if network issues
adb kill-server && adb start-server

# Check emulator connectivity
adb shell ping -c 2 8.8.8.8

# View live logs
adb logcat -s ReactNativeJS:V *:S
```

### Testing Your Fix

1. **Cold Start**: Kill app completely and restart
2. **Network Toggle**: Turn off/on wifi to test offline fallback
3. **Cache Test**: Wait 15+ minutes to test cache expiration
4. **Category Switch**: Test all news categories work

### Expected Behavior After Fix

- Articles should load within 3-5 seconds
- If network fails, shows sample articles with "Offline" indicator
- No more duplicate key warnings in logs
- Smooth category switching with cached data
- Proper error messages instead of endless loading

### Debug Mode

Add these to see what's happening:

```javascript
// In errorHandler.ts, the console.log statements will show:
// - Which APIs are being called
// - Cache hits/misses
// - Fallback attempts
// - Network timeouts
```

### Performance Metrics

- **Before Fix**: 10-30s loading time, frequent failures
- **After Fix**: 2-5s loading time, graceful degradation

### Last Resort Solutions

If still having issues:

1. **Clean Install**:
   ```bash
   npx react-native clean
   cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
   npm install
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```

2. **Use Physical Device**: Emulator network can be unreliable

3. **Check Firewall**: Ensure React Native packager isn't blocked

4. **Alternative Emulator**: Try different Android API level
